# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) and K-Means Clustering in PySpark, Python and Koalas

The source data, master_data.csv is the collection of the sales made by each customer starting from April, 2018 to May, 2019 along with the sales quantity. 
NOTE: The source data is masked for the security purpose. 

Based on the given data, I tried to group the customers using unsupervised machine learning based on these factors:
1. Recency: How recent each customer visited the store.
2. Frequency: How frequent each customer have visited the store.
3. Monetary value: What is the net monetary value generated by the customer in past.

After grouping the customers based on these 3 factors, I scored them 1-5:
1. If the score is 0-1, it will be a low-valued customer.
2. If the score is 2-4, it will be a medium-valued customer.
3. If the score is 4-6, it will be a high-valued customer.

For the distributed data, or big data, where the file size may be too much for a PC to handle, I also provided a cloud solution. Spark dataframe in Databricks 
can handle highly distributed or large datasets very efficiently. This solution can be implemented on various cloud platforms such as GCP, AWS and Azure.
